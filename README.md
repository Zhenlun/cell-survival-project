# cell-survival-project
Code for Zhenlun's summer 2023 cell survival rate project.

playground.py is the work done in this project. The rest are Medras MC files found here: https://github.com/sjmcmahon/Medras-MC

sddeditor.py repairs typos in the SDD files generated by Nico, it should be placed in the damage_results_merged folder he sent me.
